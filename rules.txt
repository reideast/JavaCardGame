Fortune's Tower is a game of chance and betting, where you must decide to play it safe, or try for more winnings by
dealing out more and more cards! The numbered cards are dealt in rows of increasing size, until eight rows are fully
dealt out in a pyramid shape. With each larger row, you might get more chips, but there is more risk of Misfortune.

A Misfortune happens when a card is dealt out and matches either of the cards above it. This normally ends the round
with no winnings, but you can be saved from a Misfortune by a Knight. If such a card is dealt out in a row, it prevents
all Misfortunes that were dealt out in that row only.

When you decide to take a row safely, you get its value in chips back into your bank. Once you take a row, the rest of
the cards are dealt out, to see if you could have gotten more chips, or if you made the right descision.

If you can deal out all eight rows of cards without a Misfortune, you will get a Jackpot! This is great fortune, since
you will receive the value of ALL the cards on the board back into your bank.

You start with 500 chips in your bank, and you must ante at least 15 chips to deal a round. You may increase the ante,
and each factor of 15 (up to 150) will multiply your winnings by that amount! How much do you want to risk each round?

When all the cards in a row match, your potential winnings will be multipled by that number of cards. So, if all three
cards in the third row match, you'll get triple what your normally would! This is cumulative with your ante multiplier.

The goal is to double your original amount of chips. If you have too few chips to make the minimum bet, the game is over.
